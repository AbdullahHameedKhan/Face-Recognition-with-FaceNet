# Face-Recognition-with-FaceNet
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating face recognition with FaceNet, a deep learning model that maps faces to a 128-dimensional space. This enables highly accurate recognition, clustering, and verification by measuring the similarity between face embeddings.
