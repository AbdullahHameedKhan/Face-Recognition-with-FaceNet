# Face-Recognition-with-FaceNet
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating face recognition with FaceNet, a deep learning model that maps faces to a 128-dimensional space. This enables highly accurate recognition, clustering, and verification by measuring the similarity between face embeddings.

# Introduction
Face recognition is a powerful and widely-used application in computer vision. The FaceNet model excels at this task by converting facial images into embeddings—a compact numerical representation—where similar faces have embeddings that are close to each other. This notebook guides you through the process of using FaceNet for face recognition, from image preprocessing to embedding extraction and final face identification.

# Features
Image Preprocessing: The notebook includes steps to preprocess facial images, including face detection, alignment, and normalization.
Embedding Extraction: Utilizes the FaceNet model to extract 128-dimensional embeddings for each detected face.
Face Recognition: Demonstrates how to use these embeddings for recognizing or verifying identities by comparing the distances between embeddings.
Visualization: Includes tools to visualize the face detection process and the distribution of embeddings in space.

# Dataset
The notebook can be used with various datasets, such as:
LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild): A commonly used dataset for benchmarking face recognition algorithms.
Custom Dataset: You can use your own dataset of facial images for training and testing.
# Dataset Preparation
If using a custom dataset, ensure that images are organized by person, with each folder containing images of a single individual.
The notebook includes code to load and preprocess these images for use with FaceNet.
# Model Architecture
FaceNet uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a triplet loss function, which minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive example of the same identity while maximizing the distance to a negative example.

# Pre-trained Model
The notebook uses a pre-trained FaceNet model, which can be loaded directly from popular deep learning libraries.
The pre-trained model is effective for most face recognition tasks without additional training.
# Workflow
Set up the environment: Install necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Load and preprocess images: The notebook includes functions to detect and align faces in images, preparing them for embedding extraction.
Extract embeddings: Use the pre-trained FaceNet model to generate 128-dimensional embeddings for each face.
Face recognition: Perform recognition by comparing embeddings. The notebook demonstrates different approaches, such as nearest neighbor search or threshold-based verification.
Visualize results: Plot the detected faces, their embeddings, and the recognition outcomes to understand the model's performance.
# Usage
Running the Notebook

# Results
The FaceNet model achieves high accuracy on face recognition tasks, often surpassing traditional methods. The notebook showcases these capabilities with examples of successful face identifications.

# Conclusion
This notebook provides a practical guide to using FaceNet for face recognition tasks. By following the steps outlined, you can leverage FaceNet’s powerful embedding-based approach to accurately identify and verify faces in images.
